# Spindle detection for the project of Applied Case Studies II

In this repository we put the files for our final project of this course. `loading_fe.ipynb` is the notebook used to load and extract features from the data, while `eda_prepro_modelling.ipynb` is used for a little EDA, preprocessing and the modelling part.
